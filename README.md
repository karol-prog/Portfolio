Welcome to my First Ever Portfolio page !!!!


From learning HTML and CSS in the Scrimba course, I decided to put my finger on a keyboard and start creating my portfolio page. In the text below, I'm going to describe technologies that I implement in my codes.

THE TECHNOLOGIES

HTML:
  - implementing semantic HTML,
  - understanding of basic concepts like div, img, button, link etc.,
  - implementing a fonts and fonts icon from fontawesom.com.

CSS:
  - Style the basic concept of the site,
  - Learning how to use pseudo elements,
