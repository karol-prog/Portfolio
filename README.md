Welcome to my First Ever Portfolio page !!!!


From learning HTML and CSS in the Scrimba course, I decided to put my finger on a keyboard and start creating my portfolio page. In the text below, I'm going to describe technologies that I implement in my codes.

THE TECHNOLOGIES

HTML:
  - implementing semantic HTML,
  - understanding of basic concepts like div, image, button, link, etc.,
  - implementing a fonts and fonts icon from fontawesom.com.

CSS:
  - Style the basic concept of the site with ID and classes,
  - Learning how to use pseudo-elements,
  - Understanding of display, transitions, animations, media queries

Javascript:
  - First time using a simple JS function for hamburger navigation with the help of Stackoverflow, but I got it. :)
  - Add a DarkTheme

Last of all I use Netlify to deploy my site to the world of the internet. (https://karolportfolio.netlify.app/)

I know the site may be imperfect, but you need to start somewhere to train perfection.
I hope you will like my website and if you have some advice for me on what I can change or make better you can contact me via my portfolio page.

Happy Coding and See you later with my next projects!!! :)
